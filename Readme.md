shitty pacman
=============

A fucking shitty implementation of Pacman.
"It'll just take an hour" I thought to myself,
as I tried to hack out a prototype.

In the end, probably more like 12.
Didn't use git b/c it was going to be throwaway code,
spent 5-10x as long on it as it should have taken,
b/c I didn't have tests. So I couldn't fix the
myriad of bad decisions I made,
and the development cycle got slower and slower.

Nonetheless, it was an interesting experiment,
and I'm fucking glad it's over.

Here's a screencap:
